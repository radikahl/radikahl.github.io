I love Spotify's new [web player](http://apps.facebook.com/get-spotify/?fb_source=notification&fb_ref=cazzette_us&ref=notif&notif_t=app_notification). No Ads and no weekly limit for no cash. I guess, that's due to its Beta status. Anyway, it's great because it works on Linux :)

Btw: Even though the link to the player sends you by Facebook, you don't need to have a FB account or link your account with Spotify.
