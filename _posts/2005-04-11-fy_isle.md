Here it is, my first Counter-Strike: Source map, *fy_isle*. It is a quite small map based on the very simple layout of fy_iceworld. However, it has some gems up its sleeves. I managed to incorporate three different game modes:

*  *Headshot*: The only way to frag is to shot in the head.
*  *Sudden Death*: The Unreal folks know this by the name *InstaGib*. For the rest: A single bullet is enough to be out till the next round.
*  *Standard*: The normal way of playing CS:S. Except no need and no possibility for buying weapons.

Update: **Good news**: fy_isle is part of the [official map pack](http://www.esl.eu/de/news/18724/Neuer-Mappool-f-r-die-3on3-Ladder/) for the ESL Funmap Ladder.
