When flying I always love to have an empty seat next to me - even better the entire row. Ryanair, however, isn’t know to be generous. But by exploiting an interesting peculiarity of their seat allocation algorithm you are able to increase the chances of having more space on your next Ryanair flight.

Most seats on Ryanair are automatically allocated when the passenger checks in. Funnily the seats of row 31 and 32 are allocated as the very last seats. Thus, if the flight isn’t fully booked, the seats of row 31 and 32 are the most likely to stay empty.

To get one of those seats you can either buy it, checkin only shortly before the deadline or just board the plane as the last person. Checking in just shortly before the 2 hour deadline should yield the best results as it reduces the likelihood that someone else is allocated to next to the potentially last empty seat. Anyhow, you can always try you look by boarding last from the rear door.

Happy Flying!
